# Shiny-TDS

Once upon a time there was a @jeffque that wished to run a select query
agaist a mssql table using Ruby.

There was a gem, and in awe he hath it found!

But it didn't worked, for it was cursed

Cursed with native bindings, cursed with a build that made no sense

So, in dispair for he hath not being able to do his binding, @jeffque sold his soul

For the demons of lore, oh creatures from the depth!

And he had broke the divine laws

With his soul sold to the old ones, he hath it done

And with a gambiarra node.js he hath invoked, from within the purest of the pure ruby

## About the project

Shiny-TDS is a Ruby project to create a gem capable of communicate with MSSQL.
There are two desireable outputs:

1. using IPC to invoke node.js and run the needed SQL commands
1. using pure Ruby to do TDS communication

## Cursed TDS

Cursed TDS is a project within Shiny-TDS that allows a ruby dev to
freely do SQL commands, assuming they have node and all needed dependencies
installed.

## Shiny-TDS

A pure ruby implementation of the TDS protocol
